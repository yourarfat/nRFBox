- When using **multiple NRF24** modules, the power demands can exceed the capabilities of the onboard power supply or regulator. Running three NRF modules simultaneously may cause instability, leading to intermittent failures or causing the nRFBox to stop functioning altogether.
- **Range Limitations**: The jammer is most effective at short range. Beyond a certain distance, the signal weakens, making it harder to consistently disrupt communication.
- **Device Variability**: Different devices react to jamming signals in varying ways. Some may be more resistant.

<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project
nRFBOX is a wireless toolkit designed to explore, analyze, and interact with various wireless communication protocols. It combines the ESP32 Wroom32U, NRF24 modules, an OLED display, and other components to create a multifunctional device that can act as a scanner, analyzer, jammer, BLE jammer, BLE spoofer, and perform advanced tasks such as the "Sour Apple" attack.

## ðŸ”— Uploading the Firmware (.bin) to ESP32

If you prefer not to upload the code manually or encounter errors during compilation, you can directly upload the precompiled `.bin` file to the ESP32. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download the Required Tools
1. **ESP32 Flash Download Tool**: Download the tool from Espressif's official site: [ESP32 Flash Download Tool](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/tools/flash_download_tool_3.9.7_2.zip).
2. **USB Drivers**: Make sure the drivers for the ESP32 are installed on your system. You can download the drivers from [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) if you're using the CP2102 chip.

### Step 2: Prepare the `.bin` File
1. Download the [precompiled `.bin`](https://github.com/cifertech/nRFBox/tree/main/precompiled%20%20bin) file from the repository. 

### Step 3: Upload the `.bin` File to ESP32
1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the **ESP32 Flash Download Tool** and configure the following:
   - Select the appropriate **chip type** (ESP32) and click **OK**.
   - In the **Download Path Config** section, add the `.bin` file and set the start address to `0x10000`.
   - Select the correct **COM port** where your ESP32 is connected.
   - Choose the correct **Baud rate** (115200 is generally recommended).

3. Click on **Start** to begin uploading the `.bin` file to your ESP32.

### Step 4: Verify the Upload
Once the upload is completed, the tool will confirm a successful flash. You can now restart your ESP32 and run the firmware.

### Arduino IDE 1.8 Settings:
If you want to upload the sketch code to the ESP32, use the following settings in the Tools menu:
- **Built using ESP32 Board Version 2.0.11**
